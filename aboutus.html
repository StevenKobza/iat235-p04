            <p class= "body-text">The team was founded in September 1965 while the Mountain Rescue Group was disbanding. It was initially established as a heavy urban search and rescue unit to assist with Civil Defense activities in case the Russians dropped a nuclear warhead in the vicinity. The team was trained in subjects like building reinforcement, welding, nuclear fallout measurement, riot control, fire fighting, auto extrication and first aid. Occasionally the local police would ask the team to assist in searching for a lost hiker or skier. Over time it was realized that there was more of a need for a wilderness search and rescue team, and not so much need for a Civil Defence unit. Soon, the team started to focus on, and train and equip for, search and rescue operations in the North Shore mountains. <br><br>
            During its history, NSR has often taken the lead in developing techniques and protocols for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. NSR was one of the first BC Search and Rescue (SAR) teams to train in human tracking, use search dogs, establish a dive team, and develop special protocols for treating hypothermia victims.
